# Interview 1

## Overview

In this interview,
I interviewed a DKU Data Science student in the class of 2024 in our class.
His name is Ian.
I chose to interview Ian because I know he did well in a computer science class
which mainly uses *FOSS*.
We did the interview face to face casually in a classroom.

## Interview questions

- What is *FOSS*?
- What are some *FOSS* you use?
    - What do you use it for?
    - Do you know how these projects are funded?
    - Are you interested in how they are funded?
- Are you willing to support these projects in any way?
    - In what ways would you support these projects?\
        e.g.
        - GitHub star or equivalent
        - recommend to others
        - enable their telemetry
        - donate to the projects
        - support the company behind them
- If you use a piece of software,
    are you responsible to pay for it?

## Knowledge and awareness of *FOSS*

Ian knew the corresponding Chinese of *FOSS*,
but he did not know that
the English abbreviation stands for Free and Open Source Software.
Nor did he know that “free” means freedom to use besides free of charge.

Ian mainly uses proprietary software
such as Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud,
which he got from either the DKU subscription or the internet for free.

Ian uses *FOSS* but was not aware of them.
He explicitly stated that he does not care about
whether the software he uses is proprietary or free
and he only cares about obtaining the software for free.

## *FOSS* the interviewee uses

When I asked Ian what is some *FOSS* he uses,
he first guessed the programming language toolchain he uses,
which is *FOSS* indeed.
The toolchain Ian uses for programming includes
the CPython Python interpreter,
Python IDLE,
and
the Java Development environment OpenJDK.

After some digging,
Ian discovered some other *FOSS* he uses.
He uses Visual Studio Code the text editor,
which corresponds to a *FOSS* project on GitHub,
but the application users download from Microsoft is proprietary.
He also used a Ubuntu GNU/Linux virtual machine on Duke VCM
when he was having Computer Science 201 class.

Ian himself concluded that he uses *FOSS* mainly for programming,
and
proprietary software for art production,
writing, and gaming.
He admitted that he generally does not care about
what kind of software as long as he gets them for free.

## Knowledge and opinion on the funding of *FOSS*

Ian claimed that he had never thought about how *FOSS* projects are funded.
He said that knowing how *FOSS* projects are funded will be interesting
only for his curiosity,
but such knowledge is irrelevant to college students.

When I told Ian that some large *FOSS* projects are funded by large enterprise companies,
Ian was surprised.
He then realized from me that large companies use *FOSS*
because they need to fund similar projects anyway,
and by doing it in a *FOSS* project,
they get programmers to work on the projects for them for free.
Ian describes this situation as a *win-win*
because the companies get free workers and the customers get free software.
He did not realize,
however,
many developers who work on these *FOSS* projects are not paid.

Ian soon realized that this *win-win* condition only applies to some *FOSS* projects.
I told him that many small *FOSS* projects have little funding,
but the developers work for free because they need the software themselves.
Ian described these phenomena as collaborations based on shared needs.
He raised an interesting example,
two people do a lab experiment together because they both need the data.

Above all,
Ian hardly cares about the funding of *FOSS*.
He believed that *FOSS* projects either are funded by large companies
because they need them,
or are developed because the developers need it,
so there is no need for college students to support them.

## Reflection on the interview

The most interesting thing I learned from this interview
is that some people care little about the freedom to use software,
but instead,
focus on getting software for free.
Ian does not seek to modify or distribute any of the software he uses,
he only wants them for free.
This means that Ian does not care about the software provider,
but only cares about his interest as a consumer.

I think I did well in getting where Ian stands quickly.
I did not do so well, though,
in giving Ian a complete idea of the *FOSS* market
and potentially tricked him to think that *FOSS* projects are
either funded by companies or are developed for free by the developers.
