# Interview 2

## Overview

In this interview,
I interviewed a DKU Data Science student in the class of 2024 in our class.
His name is Loe.
I chose to interview Loe because I know he set up a computer server at home
and has good knowledge on the topic of *FOSS*.
We did the interview on Zoom casually with both of us under lockdown.

## Interview questions

- What is *FOSS*?
- What are some *FOSS* you use?
    - What do you use it for?
    - Do you know how these projects are funded?
    - Are you interested in how they are funded?
- Are you willing to support these projects in any way?
    - In what ways would you support these projects?\
        e.g.
        - GitHub star or equivalent
        - recommend to others
        - enable their telemetry
        - donate to the projects
        - support the company behind them
- If you use a piece of software,
    are you responsible to pay for it?

## Knowledge and awareness of *FOSS*

For Loe’s understanding of *FOSS*,
he suggested that *open source* means that the project is under some protocol
like the GNU General Public License (GPL),
and *free* means that the software is provided for free to individuals.
Loe observed that
*FOSS* projects do not necessarily provide free software for commercial use.
He raised the example of Proxmox VE,
which provides free software to individuals
and has commercial promotion and paid support.
In summarizing his understanding of *FOSS*,
Loe used *free of charge* and *not cracked* as his standard to distinguish *free*,
and source *code available* online as his standard to distinguish *open source*.

## *FOSS* the interviewee uses

Loe has a long list of *FOSS* he has used.
He set up a computer server at home with a set of *FOSS*,
including
Proxmox,
Ubuntu,
TrueNAS,
and
many other *FOSS*.
Loe also experimented with more *FOSS*,
like
Docker,
code-server,
and
pfSense,
to set up cloud services on his server.
We can argue that Loe is competent in terms of general computer knowledge
and that he exploits the power of *FOSS*.

## Knowledge and opinion on the funding of *FOSS*

Loe has plenty of background knowledge about the funding of *FOSS* projects.
He mentioned that some *FOSS* projects,
like pfSense,
have companies behind them to support their development,
while others,
like qBittorrent,
are community-driven and are involved with little cash.

Loe shows a willingness to support *FOSS* projects.
He mentioned that he happily donated to his ad-blocker
although I believe it is not *FOSS*.
He also stated that he gives mental support to *FOSS* projects
and recommend or advertise them to his friends.
On the technical side,
Loe recall filing issues on the *FOSS* project repositories
which helps the developers improve the software.
For monetary support,
Loe stressed that he would more likely donate to projects that
provide a more friendly payment method.

Loe raised an interesting point, though,
that *FOSS* projects being “free” indicates that
the authors of the software do not accept payment.
He argues that,
if developers are paid for *FOSS*,
then it is not actually “free.”

## Reflection

The most interesting thing I learned from this interview is that
some consumers decide whether they want to pay for software based on
the software providers’ indication.
Loe donated to the ad-blocker because the ad-blocker asked him to donate
and gave him a QR code for WeChat payment.
In comparison,
He does not believe that *FOSS* projects ask for donations because
they mark themselves “free.”

I think I did well in stimulating Loe to talk more about how he uses *FOSS*.
But, I think I did not do so well in following him
and understanding all the *FOSS* he uses,
and I probably misunderstood some of his use cases.
