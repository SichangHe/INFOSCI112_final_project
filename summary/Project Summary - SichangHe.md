## Main point 1

One important reason why Chinese people mainly focus on
getting software free of charge
and neglect whether the software is *FOSS* or proprietary
is because software piracy is extremely popular in China.

### Example #1

In our interview,
Mei (2022) explicitly stated that he only cares about getting the software for free
and he does not care about whether the software is *FOSS* or proprietary.
Mei is a typical Chinese software user.
Besides downloading the software DKU provides,
he searches online for the software he needs,
and download the free version.
Many pieces of software are proprietary and paid,
but Mei got them for free,
because he got the pirated version.

### Example #2

The internet in China is full of pirated software floating around.
Many times,
when I search for a piece of software on [Baidu](www.baidu.com),
the first page of the search result is filled with
various websites that provide free downloads.
According to Business Software Alliance (2018),
unlicensed commercial software in China would be worth
\$6.8 billion if they were commercial,
while the number for the whole world is \$46.3 billion.
This study shows that,
China is the country with the most software piracy.
Therefore,
the popularity of software piracy is one important reason why
DKU students mainly focus on getting software for free.

## Main point 2

Some people neglect their liberty using software,
that is,
“the freedom to run,
edit,
contribute to,
and share the software”
(FSF, 2022),
largely due to the difficulty to “edit” or “contribute to” the software.

### Example #1

Mei (2022) suggested that he has mainly used *FOSS* for programming
but not for other fields.
Considering Mei got to use many of the software because they are popular,
for example,
Microsoft Office,
Adobe Creative Cloud,
and OpenJDK,
his software usage shows that *FOSS* is popular in the programming field
and only in the programming field.
Mei does not “edit” or “contribute to” software he uses,
and by using pirated software,
he can “run” and “share” the software without problems
(assuming that the pirated software is safe),
so *FOSS* does not effectively give him more liberty than pirated software.
Most people who “edit” or “contribute to” software are programmers,
and some non-programmers such as Mei do not need the liberty
so they neglect their liberty in these fields.

### Example #2

Bi (2022) did not mention modifying the *FOSS* they use despite
using a lot of *FOSS* and being a proficient programmer.
Bi has a long list of *FOSS* he has used for his various projects
including his home computer server,
but he did not mention editing or contributing to these *FOSS* projects
in our interview.
The furthest he has gone is likely filing issues in these projects’ repositories.
If Bi, being a programmer who has done several projects,
finds it difficult to “edit” or “contribute to” *FOSS* projects,
it would be even more difficult for average users.
Since average users can hardly “edit” or “contribute to” software they use,
they probably tend to neglect these aspects of their software liberty.

## Main point 3

Most people do not make the association that
they should financially support the *FOSS* they use.

### Example #1

Loe (2022) suggested that *FOSS* are not supposed to be paid.
He argues that,
if the developers open source a piece of software,
they indicate that they do not want to be paid.
This,
as Loe (2022) puts,
is because the developers make the software *free*,
and it should not be paid if free.
If Loe,
someone who extensively uses *FOSS* and has a decent knowledge about *FOSS*,
does not think that he should financially support *FOSS* projects,
someone who uses *FOSS* less and has less knowledge would
less likely make the association that they should financially support *FOSS*.

### Example #2

People on the internet found that
open source projects cannot rely on donations.
On Reddit,
user Helad00 (2019) questions the open source community
why not everyone asks for donations for open source software.
Most answers they got state that most people do not donate to *FOSS*
and relying *FOSS* development on donations is extremely difficult.
One of the replies cites the diatribe by Chris Aniszczyk (2019),
which,
from the real-world examples of Patreon,
OpenSSL,
and other open source related projects,
concluded that donations cannot support open source projects in general.
These real-world cases provide evidence that most people do not
think about financially supporting *FOSS*.
