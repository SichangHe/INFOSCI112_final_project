# DKU students’ perspectives on supporting Free And Open Source Software

<article class="author">Steven Hé (Sīchàng)</article>

## What ‘technology’ or tech company are you writing about?
<!-- (1-3 words) -->
Free and open source software (*FOSS*).

## What audience will you focus on that uses or is affected by this technology?

DKU student.

## What is the related ethical concern?
<!-- (1-3 words) -->
Meanings of intellectual work.

## Introduction
<!-- (the what): 
the proposal should begin with an overview of the topic you will investigate -->
We propose to study DKU students’ perspectives
on supporting the Free and Open Source Software (*FOSS*) they use.

*FOSS* as intellectual work does not translate directly into any profit.
While the traditional proprietary software is typically sold to the customer
with an End User License Agreement (*EULA*)
or with ads embedded
so its developers earn profits directly,
*FOSS* are provided to anyone free of charge with the freedom to interact.
This means that the developers of *FOSS* cannot directly make profits with the software
—their intellectual work.
*FOSS* development and maintenance are usually conducted
by volunteers or funded by donations,
either from cooperations or individuals.

*FOSS* could have funding problems.
Recently, for example, *faker.js*,
a JavaScript library was deleted by its owner because of the lack of funding.
Many other *FOSS* likely lack funding too.
<!-- and include a research statement or question that is clear, focused and doable.
It should cover the technology, the audience, and the ethical concern listed above.
You should let your reader know in the introduction that this is an ethnographic study. -->
As individuals,
how much support and moral responsibility do DKU students believe
they should give to the *FOSS* they use?
This research question,
in the sense of ethnographic study,
projects on DKU students’ perspectives on the meanings of intellectual work.

## Research Goals
<!-- what motivates you to do this research. 
Why did you choose this overarching topic and/or subtopics? ______________________________________________________________________________ -->
By studying DKU students’ perspectives on supporting *FOSS*,
we can hopefully peek at how the young generation is likely to interact with *FOSS*.
How young people see supporting *FOSS* will likely decide how far *FOSS* can go.
If young people are not willing to support *FOSS*,
it would probably have very limited influence in the world like it has now,
or even go obsolete.
If young people are eager to support *FOSS*,
we may be able to see a boost in *FOSS* development.
DKU students may represent a view from the young generation towards *FOSS*.

## Research Methods
<!-- describe the type of literature research you think will be most useful
(e.g. company webpages, scholarly articles, etc.) -->
Because *FOSS* is virtual,
most of the interactions with *FOSS* are online.
Many *FOSS* projects have their community websites
or community [*subreddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/).
By checking these forums and posts,
we can abstract a general idea on
what the internet people think about supporting *FOSS*.
<!-- the types of people you may interview -->
We would interview people with prior knowledge of *FOSS*
because it could be complicated to explain *FOSS* to someone that does not know it.
<!-- and a possible site you could visit (virtual or physical)
to help you understand your topic. -->
The Free Software Foundation (*FSF*) is an iconic *FOSS* organization.
Their [website](https://www.fsf.org)
explains the idea of *FOSS* and
contains a vast number of different *FOSS* related content.
*FSF* and various other organizations host *FOSS* conferences
like the [Open Source Software Conferences](https://conferenceindex.org/conferences),
which could help us understand the current stage of *FOSS*.

## Problems or Challenges
<!-- briefly address the possible problems or challenges
that may arise while you do this research and how you might deal with them. -->
It could be hard to let the interviewees think of *FOSS* in general,
as *FOSS* is a broad idea.
We would let the interviewees think about specific pieces of software they use,
and reflect on their use of them.

Our interviewees may also be biased towards *FOSS*
because they already know about *FOSS*.
We would need to consider the influence when analyzing the interview.

## Conclusion
<!-- (the ”so what?”)
Why is your research important and how does it relate to larger social and ethical issues
(e.g. reliability of information, politics, privacy, or identity)?  -->
Free and open source software is not just computer programs,
it is a flagship of the open source idea.
Open source means that everyone can access the tools and knowledge they need,
regardless of their background or position
—the open source idea serves humanity as a whole.
Young generations would be the main developers as well as the main users of *FOSS*.
How much they would support *FOSS* would play a major factor
in the sustainability of the *FOSS* model.
Based on the attitude of young people towards *FOSS*,
we can act correspondingly and help *FOSS* improve.
Moreover, a generation that would support *FOSS* is also likely to support
open knowledge and other ideas or practices that
promote openness and serve the whole human community.
It is promising to have a more open world,
but it is more practical to study what we could expect
based on specific problems,
like the young generations’ perspectives on supporting the *FOSS* they use.
