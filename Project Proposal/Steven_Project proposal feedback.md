Steven - You've done a good job identifying an important topic that is relevant to your interests. The issue of free and open software and studentsâ€™ perspectives on its importance and availability will be interesting to explore.

Your idea to connect the use, development, and acceptance of FOSS with the production of knowledge shows an understanding of the importance of making information more accessible and how this development can encourage innovation.

Please be aware that your interviews will give you information about how two students view FOSS but should not be used to generalize more broadly about student populations. Hopefully, your interviewees will give you thoughtful comments that will allow you to think more deeply about some of the choices available to college students, particularly DKU students. The development of FOSS is closely tied to the availability of financial resources and time. Its acceptance may also be tied to the tenure process that drives many research universities.

Good job on your project proposal. -- Linda
